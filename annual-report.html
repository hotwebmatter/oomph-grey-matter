        <h3 class="h2">Creating new choices in coordinated care</h3>
        <p>Responding to our customers, we expanded network options to help businesses offer the most appropriate choices to their employees. BlueCHiP New England plans extend the advantages of coordinated care to workers across the region. We also partnered with the Lifespan system to introduce BlueCHiP Direct Advance on HealthSource RI. Overall, we increased the number of members enrolled in coordinated care plans. We know from national studies as well as our own data and analysis that employees who have regular access to a highly capable primary care provider, one who coordinates all of their care, are healthier. They also are less likely to receive unnecessary care or expensive services that deliver little value.</p>

            <p>To better serve the East Bay community, we opened a flagship store in East Providence in 2017, which joined our locations in Warwick and Lincoln. Our new store built on the success we already had with our retail stores, helping our customers improve their health and more easily understand their healthcare. Our three Your Blue Store locations offer:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sales and service staff to help with questions and plan choices, in English and Spanish </li>
              <li>Free exercise classes for members and community events</li>
              <li>An on-site nurse to help members manage ongoing health conditions</li>
              <li>Health screenings for blood pressure and body mass index</li>
            </ul>
